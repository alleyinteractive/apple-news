## Releasing the Plugin

The plugin uses a [built release workflow](./.github/workflows/built-release.yml)
to compile and tag releases. Whenever a new version is detected in the root
`composer.json` file or in the plugin's headers, the workflow will automatically
build the plugin and tag it with a new version. The built tag will contain all
the required front-end assets the plugin may require. This works well for
publishing to WordPress.org or for submodule-ing.

When you are ready to release a new version of the plugin, you can run
`npm run release` to start the process of setting up a new release.
